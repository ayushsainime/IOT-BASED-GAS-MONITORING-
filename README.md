 IoT-Based Intelligent LPG Leakage and Weight Monitoring System
This project is a smart safety system designed to detect LPG gas leaks and monitor cylinder weight in real-time. Built using Arduino, NodeMCU, and various sensors, the system ensures early warning and automatic response to potential gas hazards. It not only alerts users through Blynk and Telegram notifications but also automates safety actions like valve shut-off and buzzer alerts, reducing risks in domestic and commercial settings.

 Features
 Real-time gas leak detection using MQ5 sensor
 Cylinder weight monitoring using Load Cell + HX711
 Visual and audible alerts via LEDs and Buzzer
 Remote notifications using Blynk IoT and Telegram Bot
Automatic gas cut-off with Solenoid Valve
LCD display of gas levels and system status
Wi-Fi integration via NodeMCU (ESP8266)

Technologies Used
